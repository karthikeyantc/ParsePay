# SMS Text Extraction with Machine Learning

This project is designed to train a machine learning model to extract text from SMS messages. It aims to replicate the output of the rule-based logic used in the `sms-transaction-detector` project.

## Features
- Machine learning-based text extraction.
- Mimics the behavior of the rule-based system.

## Setup
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python extensions in Visual Studio Code.
3. Follow the instructions in the `copilot-instructions.md` file for workspace-specific guidance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Stores trained models and related files.
- `scripts/`: Includes Python scripts for training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

## Usage
- Train the model using the provided dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance against the rule-based system.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by improving the model or adding new features.
